WP Speed of Light is a WordPress speedup plugin and load time testing. Cache, Gzip, minify, group, Lazy Loading, CDN

== Description ==

WordPress does not have a system for speed optimization by default. That's why you need a powerful plugin that speed up WordPress with technical and advanced features, yet accessible to everyone. 
WP Speed of Light starts with an advanced static cache, plus, you got a file minification and group tools, a database cleanup system, a .htaccess optimization, an auto-cache cleaner and a full CDN integration.

When it comes to performance loading time, it requires some test to identify which plugin, theme, page may require more attention.
WP Speed of Light also includes a speed loading test and compare, and a database queries test. To go one step beyond with your WordPress speed, a PRO ADDON upgrade (optional) with custom support is available.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is WP Speed of Light 3rd party compatible? =
It is, of course we can't test with all dynamic element, yet you have some options to exclude some specific URL from optimization. You are welcome to send us compatibility request on our pre-sale forum or on the plugin directory support forum.

= Can I use the plugin to do a Gutenberg Speedup optimization? =
Yes sure, WP Speed of Light have a dedicated integration with Gutenberg, it can auto cleanup the content cache on saving.

= Is WP Speed of Light free? =
Yes, totally free of charge, fell free to install, update and even ask us questions on the WordPress plugin directory forum. We offer an optional free upgrade.

= Is WP Speed of Light translated into other languages than English? =
Yes, we use a translation tool accessible from the plugin setting where you can: get languages, translate, share translation with us (and get a gift for that)

= Is WP Speed of Light compatible with WooCommerce? =
Yes, we have added some specific code to remove specific dynamic data from cache.

= How can I activate 100% of the optimization features? =
In the plugin we've made a distinction between casual optimization like caching, Gzip compression, headers expire, query strings and advanced optimization like file group and minify.
You can activate all optimizations but, depending on your website, number, and complexity of your plugins, that you remove some files or pages from this optimization to avoid problems.
All websites cannot be 100% optimized, even the big websites on the market like amazon.com

= How can I get 100% on pagespeed test? =
Some Google pagespeed recommendations require that you modify your plugin code, at least how the script are called, to defer some script loading, for example.
At Google they're actually smart enough not to consider a score based on criteria you can't apply on all website BUT on loading time (refer to the Google Search Console)
Our recommendation here: 
1. Focus only on loading time, not on your score
2. Use WebPageTest.org instead
3. All the tools are available to get a 100% page speed score in the plugin

= Is WP Speed of Light compatible with any CDN? (Cloudflare, KeyCDN, MaxCDN) =
Yes, because the CDN resource call use URLs along with content inclusion and exclusion options only, so you can use any CDN service.

= Is WP Speed of Light compatible with Varnish cache =
Yes, there's a specific integration in the optional pro addon, that offer the automatic Varnish cache cleanup on content save and manual cleanup.

= Is WP Speed of Light compatible with Siteground SuperCacher cache =
Yes, there's a specific integration in the optional pro addon, that offer the automatic Siteground SuperCacher cache cleaup on content save and manual cleaup.

= What is the image lazy loading? =
Lazy Load delays loading of images in long web pages. Images outside of viewport will not be loaded before the user scrolls to them. This is super efficient on pages with a large number of images.
You also have an option to exclude URL from lazy loading.

= Can I make a custom integration with another plugin? =
Sure, WP Speed of Light is developer-friendly and contains several Hooks and Filters detailed here:
